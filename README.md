# SEPA View
SEPA View is a web application developed to display live and historical data observed by heterogeneous sensor networks.
It is a platform powered by SEPA (SPARQL Event Processing Architecture) which implements a publish-subscribe paradigm over Linked Data
and is composed by a set of clients which can interoperate thanks to shared ontologies.

## Getting Started
This instruction will give you a copy of this dashboard on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
This repository include a [demo](https://github.com/arces-wot/SEPAview/tree/master/demo) directory, which allows you to generate fake data.

### Prerequisites
Before having fun with SEPA View, make sure you have a SEPA running on your machine. If not, please go to [SEPABins](https://github.com/arces-wot/SEPABins) repository and follow the instructions, then come back here.

### Installing
Clone the repository: ```https://github.com/arces-wot/SEPAview.git```

### Testing
1) From a command shell move to [demo](https://github.com/arces-wot/SEPAview/tree/master/demo) directory and run: ```java -jar MQTTDemo.jar arces-demo.jsap```. With this command you start simulating sensors data.
2) Move to your cloned repository and open [index.html](https://github.com/arces-wot/SEPAview/blob/master/index.html) in your browser.
